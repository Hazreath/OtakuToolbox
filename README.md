# OtakuToolbox 4.20 (fortwaini)
A handy and kind tool to assemble all your scans into one and only big pdf file !

Is your scan download tool making a folder per chapter and you're tired to switch to one folder to another ?
No worries ! OtakuToolbox will allow you to fetch all those separated file into a big pdf file !

# How to use 
1 - Specify to the program where is your main scan file located : you must have the "chapter folders" into a bigger file AND ONLY THOSE.
2 - Check that all files in those folders are correctly sorted (if you dl your scan by chapter, this is already done)
3 - Specify the location where you wanna save the .pdf, and name it
4 - Wait a bit, (watch animes)
